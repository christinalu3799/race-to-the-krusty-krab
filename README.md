# Race to the Krusty Krab 

## What is it? 
This is a simple 2-player racing game made with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 

## How do you play? 

The screen will be split in half, with Player 1 on the left and Player 2 on the right. Player 1 will use the 'wasd' keys on the keyboard to accelerate and move left/right around the boat mobiles. Likewise, Player 2 (on the right), will use the arrow keys on the right of the keyboard to accelerate and move left/right. The goal of the game is to make it to the finish line first. Whichever player crosses the finish line first will win and mark the end of the game. If both players lose (hit other boat mobiles), then the game will end.
